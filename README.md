# Draw.io Configuration

With the *draw.io configuration* app you can edit your custom configuration for draw.io. This app will generate a custom configuration based on the information from the draw.io helpdesk ([see here](https://desk.draw.io/support/solutions/articles/16000058316-how-to-configure-draw-io-)). You are able to add custom colors, presets and fonts to draw.io.

## configure online
You can open the configurator on [drawio-config.herokuapp.com](https://drawio-config.herokuapp.com/)


## Add your configuration to Draw.io
